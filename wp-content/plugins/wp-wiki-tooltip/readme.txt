Adds explaining tooltips querying their content from a MediaWiki installation, e.g. Wikipedia.org.

== Description ==

Adds explaining tooltips querying their content from a [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org "see MediaWiki docs") installation, e.g. [Wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org "see the well-known Wikipedia"). Therefore shortcodes can be used in Posts and Pages to mark keywords and link them to public Wiki pages. The well-known package of [Tooltipster](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/ "Tooltipster rocks :)") is used to create the nice and themable tooltips.

Main features of the current version are:

* Setup at least one wanted Wiki base and several other options at a backend page
* Integrate the Wiki tooltip using shortcodes in Posts and Pages
* shortcodes can be created by a TinyMCE plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use any Wiki installation as base for my tooltips? =

Sure, as long as the used installation provides an API structured like the [API of MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page "see API of MediaWiki") it will work perfectly! You can use one of the public Wikipedias or setup your own Wiki URL.

= Can I use several Wikis at the same time within my WordPress? =

Since version 1.4.0 the plugin provides the opportunity to manage multiple Wiki URLs! The wanted Wiki can be chosen via an attribute in the shortcode.

= Am I able to style the links to Wiki pages in another way than all other links in the blog? =

Yes, you can define extra CSS style properties that are used at all links to Wiki pages!

= Can I disable tooltips for mobile access? =

Since version 1.7.0 you can define a minimum screen width that is necessary to show the tooltips!
